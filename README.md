## ✅ Benefits of Having a `README.md` Before Pushing

* Acts as the landing page of your project
* Explains purpose, structure, and tech used
* Links to your `docs/` for detailed diagrams
* Shows effort and polish when recruiters or collaborators view the repo

# 🏠 Smart Home Semantic System

This project integrates Semantic Web technologies, IoT device modeling, and SPARQL querying into a cohesive smart home simulation. It is designed to help you learn:

- Ontology modeling using **Protégé**
- Semantic querying with **SPARQL**
- Simulated IoT device data
- Semantic rule-based processing
- Documentation-driven system design

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/smart-home-semantic.git
   cd smart-home-semantic
   ```

2. Open the ontology file in [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/).
